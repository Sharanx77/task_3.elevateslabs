## 📖 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a web development internship task. The focus was on utilizing **Flexbox** to create a layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, moving beyond rigid block structures to dynamic alignment.

### Key Features
* **Flexible Containers:** Applied `display: flex` to parent containers to manage layout direction and alignment.
* **Responsive Navigation:** A horizontal navigation bar that adjusts automatically based on the device width.
* **Card Layout:** Multiple content cards aligned in rows using `justify-content` and `align-items` for precise spacing.
* **Mobile Adaptability:** Utilized `flex-wrap` to ensure content moves to the next line on smaller screens, preventing overflow.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic Structure.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox (`flex-direction`, `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`).
* **Tools:** VS Code, Browser DevTools.
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages.
